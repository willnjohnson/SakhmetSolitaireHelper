# Sakhmet Solitaire Helper

This GreaseMonkey script enhances the Sakhmet Solitaire game on Neopets by providing visual cues for playable cards, helping players identify optimal moves more easily.

**Note:** This script is in no way perfect, but it can help the user to avoid making blind mistakes.

## Features

* **Dynamic Card Highlighting:**

    * Script looks for Source Card -> Destination Card
    * Source Card will be initially highlighted magenta
    * Destination Card will be highlighted magenta, if Source Card is selected

* **Simpler Background:** Uses dark green background, since Sakhmet Solitaire's background personally gives me eyestrain.
